## [osmolyar/page-object-structure-with-cucumber](https://github.com/osmolyar/page-object-structure)

Boilerplate project for WebdriverIO with Cucumber.  Navigation modeling, advanced page object structure, Cucumber world context, business options, cucumber step data parsing methods.

- Frameworks:
  - WebdriverIO v6
  - @wdio/cucumber-framework
  - Typescript
- Features:
  - Increased modularization
      - Page object structure leveraging return of landing page instances on navigation to pages
        - Isolates step definition files and page object classes from dependencies on downstream pages.
        - No need to import each page class that will be navigated to.
        - Increases the modularity of the framework and enforces guardrails on methods defined within a page
        - Implicitly validates having landed on the correct page inside each page's constructor
          - Calls a method to validate some page indicator (e.g., title).
            - Parametrized with validation parameter to prevent page validation at compile time
          - Further enforces expected navigation results prior to interacting with a page's elements
        - Allows the framework to model the navigation structure of the application
        - Steps can traverse multiple pages using a single method.
      - Page Ui services separate from page objects
        - Model higher-level business logic
        - Page objects contain only DOM-level logic
        - Ui services import those of downstream pages and define relationships among pages
      - Separation of validation and navigation logic
        - Collect artifacts for validation during navigation
        - Capture in validationOptions business option objects
        - Compare to expected values using subsequent validation steps
  - Use of Cucumber 'world' object with custom World constructor
    - Initialize functionality-specific business option objects
    - Populate business options with step definitions
    - Step definitions pass only required business options, validation options to ui Service methods
    - Step definitions examples using various Cucumber data-tables methods
      - (https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/master/features/data_tables.feature)
  - Custom browser and element commands
    - With color logging and parameterized wait and trailing wait options
  - Generic utilities
  - Spec, Allure and custom reporters
